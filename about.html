        <h2>Who made this site?</h2>
        <p>
          Wings Of Discovery is a simple website made by kids who are curious
          about drones and artificial intelligence. It's a place to share
          projects, ideas, and things we learn.
        </p>

        <h3>Our goals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn how drones can help people understand places.</li>
          <li>Explore how computers can learn from pictures.</li>
          <li>Share fun, safe projects that other kids can try with adults.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Contact</h3>
